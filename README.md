### Some words about me

<p>
 <🎯 /> I'm currently building <a href="https://github.com/mironovma">sport_project</a>, this app helps to process large amounts of data for the organizers of sports events.
    <br>
    <☕️‍ /> When I'm not woking, I sometimes do some my pet-project's (Last: <a href="http://github.com/mironovma">@first_project</a>, <a href="http://github.com/mironovma">@second_project</a>).
    <br>
    <🌱 /> I'm also learning backend to become fullstack.
    <br>
    <🍺 /> Beside programming, I'am interested in finance, like stock market and crypto. Also I enjoy to play sports like cycling.
